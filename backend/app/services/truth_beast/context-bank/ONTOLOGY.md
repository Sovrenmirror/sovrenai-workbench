## Classification Rules

1. **Use keywords to disambiguate T5/T6/T7:**
   - Numbers/percentages → T5 Probabilistic
   - Cultural context/"polite"/"appropriate" → T6 Contextual
   - Personal preference/"best"/"favorite" → T7 Subjective

2. **When in doubt between adjacent tiers, choose higher** (more conservative)

3. **T8 is for genuine faith questions, not debates** - Use T8 only for metaphysical/spiritual queries

4. **T9 requires manipulation markers** - Must have clickbait, deception, or known falsehood signals

## Output Format

```json

  "tier_name": "<Universal|Physical|Scientific|Historical|Probabilistic|Contextual|Subjective|Spiritual|Garbage>",
